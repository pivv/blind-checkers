# blind-checkers

This repository is related to the final project of Computational Modeling class in Seoul National University. <br/>
The goal is to create an artificial intelligence of "Blind Checkers" to be explained.

The Blind Checkers is a variation of the Checkers. It is almost similar to Checkers, except you cannot see all of your opponents. <br/>
More precisely, each piece in Blind Checkers has own field of view, and you cannot see anything out of sight. <br/>
Therefore, not only catching opponent pieces but securing a broad view will be an important strategy. <br/>
